3. Chinese Remainder Theorem 

i. Describe all integers such that $n \equiv 3$ (mod 5) and $n \equiv 6$ (mod 7) 

This is a basic example of applying Chinese remainder Theorem, while the shared notes did cover this I found it to be easier to follow this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoTEKjS61kI by Michael Penn.

We can apply CRT here because 5 and 7, our modulos, are coprime.
