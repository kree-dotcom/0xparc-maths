Application of Viete's formula 

https://brilliant.org/wiki/vietas-formula/

Viete's formula:
Let $P(x) = a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_0$ be a polynomial with complex coefficients and degree $n$, having complex roots $r_n,r_{n-1},...r_1$. Then for any integer $k \in [0,n]$,

$sum\limits_{1 \leq i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_k \leq n} r_{i_1} r_{i_2} ... r_{i_k} = (-1)^k \frac{a_n -k}{a_n}$

A specific case of this formula allows us to calculate the product of the roots like so:

$r_1r_2...r_n = (-1)^n \frac{a_0}{a_n}$.

Because  we are told $f(x)$ has a leading coefficient of 1 we know $a_n = 1$ and as $f(0) = 10$ this must mean the constant term, $a_0 = 10$. Therefore when $f(x)$ has an even degree we will have the product of roots as $10$. When $f(x)$ has an odd degree then the power of $-1$ will be odd and so the product of roots will be $-10$. 

Finally if the leading coefficient was 5 then the product of roots will be divided by $a_n =5$ meaning the product of roots is $2$ or $-2$ for even or odd degrees respectively.
