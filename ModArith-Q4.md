4. Modular Inverses

i. $5n + 7 \equiv 2 \pmod{13}$

subtract 7

$5n \equiv -5 \equiv 8 \pmod{13}$

Multiply by multiplicative inverse of $5  \pmod{13}$, 8. 
This can quickly be found by recognising that $5*5 \equiv 25 \equiv -1 \pmod{13}$
Therefore $5* -5 \equiv 1 \pmod{13}$ and $-5 \equiv 8 \pmod{13}$

$n \equiv 64 \equiv 12 \pmod{13}$

ii. $3n + 9 \equiv 4 \pmod{12}$

This has no solution because reduced it becomes $3n \equiv 7 \pmod{12}$ and 3 and 12 are not coprime but 7 is not divisible by their factor 3.

iii. $3n + 9 \equiv 3 \pmod{12}$

Here there is a common factor of 3 so we divide by it to gain:

$n +3 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$

$n \equiv 2 \pmod{4}$

However as the original problem was $\pmod{12}$ we must state all solutions so when $n \in (2,6,10)$

iv. $19n \equiv 1 \pmod(257)$ 19,1 and 257 are all prime so the problem cannot be reduced.

We wish to find the multiplicative inverse of $19 \pmod{257}$, 230. 

You can find this using euclidean backwards substitution (also called extended euclidean algorithm).

It is also possible to find the answer using a special multiplicative inverse calculator that you can find online if you are short of time.
